In 2018, NYC Parks and the Health Department began installing syringe kiosks in select parks across the Bronx as as part of a [plan to reduce the prevalence of discarded syringes](https://www.nycgovparks.org/news/press-releases?id=21566). The plan is part of HealingNYC, the City’s initiative to combat the opioid epidemic stemmed from success seen in similar initiatives in Vancouver, Canada and Seatlle, WA, according to NYC Parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver. NYC Parks and local syringe exchange programs deploy staff with blood-borne pathogen training to regularly empty, clean and disinfect kiosks. In addition to installing kiosks, the City works with local syringe exchange programs to increase outreach to people who use drugs in Bronx parks, providing overdose prevention education, information on health and social services, and distributing personal syringe containers.  

Critics of the plan claim that installing syringe kiosks invite and encourage addicts to use drugs in the parks. However, the reality is that people are already using in the parks and disposing of their used needles under benches, bushes, and other places in the parks posing an imminent public health threat to adults, children, and pets that come in contact with them. Coming in contact with needles puts those at risk for contracting infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C and HIV.

# Load Data

The [Summary of Syringe Data in NYC Parks dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Summary-of-Syringe-Data-in-NYC-Parks/t8xi-d5wb) was procured from the [Open NYC Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). The [Parks Properties](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Properties/enfh-gkve) is also an Open NYC Data dataset which was brought in to gather additional data on the parks where syringes are collected. 

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}

## Dimensions, Variable types, Labels, Levels, and Frequencies


### Summary of Syringe Data in NYC Parks  

This dataset contains records of syringes collected, including how many, whether they are collected from the ground or a kiosk, and when they are collected. The Syringe Summary dataset contains records for syringes collected by both Parks staff as well as collection efforts by the [Washington Heights Corner Project](https://www.nycservice.org/organizations/index.php?org_id=1462) and [New York Harm Reduction Educators](https://nyhre.org/) nonprofit group. Each row one instance or one day's total of syringes collected in a park from the ground or safe disposal kiosk.

From the below two functions, the dimensions of the dataset: 24651 rows, 23 columns. The variables read in do not contain any labels and as neither variable is a factor type, there are no factor levels to report. Additionally, the table contains 15 character type variables, 1 double variable, and 7 integer variables.
```{r}
glimpse(df_syr)

look_for(df_syr)

table(look_for(df_syr)$col_type)
```

Below are the counts of unique values for each variable. The purpose of this is to identify if there are any variables that may require a change of variable type from its originally loaded type.

```{r}
# Counts of unique values/levels for each character variable
rapply(df_syr, function(x) length(unique(x)))

# unique(df_syr$group)
# unique(df_syr$source)
```


After reviewing the variables, some are updated below. Not all variables will be updated as they will be dropped in the feature selection section.
```{r}
df_syr<- df_syr %>%
  mutate(collected_date =as.Date(str_sub(collected_date, start=1, end=10),format='%m/%d/%Y'),
         kiosk_site = as.logical(toupper(kiosk_site)),
         kiosk_syringes = as.integer(kiosk_syringes),
         collection_type = 
           case_when(is.na(ground_syringes) & is.na(kiosk_syringes)  ~ "None",
                     (ground_syringes >= 0 & is.na(kiosk_syringes)) ~ "Ground",
                     (is.na(ground_syringes) & kiosk_syringes >= 0) ~ "Kiosk",
                     (ground_syringes >= 0 & kiosk_syringes >= 0) ~ "Ground & Kiosk"
                     ),
         month_year = paste(month_text, year),
         month = factor(month, levels= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)),
         month_text = factor(month_text, levels= c("Jan", "Feb","Mar","Apr",
                                                   "May","Jun","Jul","Aug",
                                                   "Sep", "Oct", "Nov","Dec")),
         borough = case_when(substring(df_syr$district,1,1) == "M" ~ "Manhattan",
                             substring(df_syr$district,1,1)=="X" ~ "Bronx",
                             substring(df_syr$district,1,1) == "R" ~ "Staten Island",
                             substring(df_syr$district,1,1) == "Q" ~ "Queens",
                             substring(df_syr$district,1,1) == "B" ~ "Brooklyn"
                             )
         )
 
str(df_syr)
```

### Parks Properties 

This dataset, provided by the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), identifies property managed partially or solely by NYC Parks. This data has been produced in whole or part using secondary data and is currently owned by the NYC Parks Open Data Team. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified.

Records are added as more land is designated under NYC Parks’ jurisdiction. Each record represents an acquisition.
```{r}
df_pk<- df_pk %>% select(c("GISPROPNUM","ACRES","JURISDICTION","COMMUNITYBOARD",
                           "COUNCILDISTRICT","SUBCATEGORY","TYPECATEGORY",
                           "WATERFRONT"))
glimpse(df_pk)

table(look_for(df_pk)$col_type)
```


Below shows counts of unique values/levels for each character variable and preliminary data cleaning is conducted.
```{r}
# df_pk<- df_pk %>% select(c("GISPROPNUM","ACRES","JURISDICTION","COMMUNITYBOARD",
#                            "COUNCILDISTRICT","SUBCATEGORY","TYPECATEGORY",
#                            "WATERFRONT"))

# Counts of unique values/levels for each character variable
rapply(df_pk %>% keep(is.character), function(x) length(unique(x)))

#display top 10 levels and corresponding counts of selected variables
#df_pk %>% count(JURISDICTION) %>% arrange(-n) %>% head(10)

#first display numeric as non-scientific number, then convert to char, then trim whitespace
df_pk$COMMUNITYBOARD<-trimws(as.character(format(df_pk$COMMUNITYBOARD,scientific = FALSE)))
df_pk$COUNCILDISTRICT<-trimws(as.character(format(df_pk$COUNCILDISTRICT,scientific = FALSE)))

#split strings for community board and council district values, update decimal, and var type
df_pk<-df_pk %>% 
  mutate(COMMUNITYBOARD = ifelse(nchar(df_pk$COMMUNITYBOARD)==3,
                                 df_pk$COMMUNITYBOARD,
                                 str_sub(gsub('(.{3})','\\1,',df_pk$COMMUNITYBOARD),end=-2)),
         COUNCILDISTRICT =  ifelse(nchar(df_pk$COUNCILDISTRICT)==2,
                                 df_pk$COUNCILDISTRICT,
                                 str_sub(gsub('(.{2})','\\1,',df_pk$COUNCILDISTRICT),end=-2)),
         ACRES = round(ACRES,2),
         WATERFRONT = as.logical(toupper(WATERFRONT))
         )

#change column cases to lowercase  
names(df_pk) <- tolower(names(df_pk))

#glimpse(df_pk)
```

Next, the syringe collection data is merged with the parks data.
```{r}
df <- left_join(x=df_syr, y=df_pk, by="gispropnum", relationship = "many-to-many")

glimpse(df)  
```

## Variable Dependencies and Definitions

Variable with dependency on two other variables in the dataset:  
`total_syringes` = `ground_syringes` + `kiosk_syringes`  
  
Variables that are a subset of one other variable:
`year`, `month`, `month_text`, `week`, `time_of_day`, `collected_date` are granular versions of the  `created_date` variable  

The [Summary of Syringe Data in NYC Parks dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Summary-of-Syringe-Data-in-NYC-Parks/t8xi-d5wb) was procured from the [Open NYC Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). The dataset has a [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSUqd1peSc-4D2XnBZNiLdxa0Jg4z62D/edit#gid=1183788427) available for the variables which provides a description along with other relevant information for each variable.  

The [Parks Properties](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Properties/enfh-gkve) is also an Open NYC Data dataset which was brought in to gather additional data on the parks where syringes are collected. The [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q4DBWu7riNFxWvy1vnTJHoOI3r2L9oW6eCN56jCNyCw/edit#gid=0) for the Parks Properties dataset in addition to the [user guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NExNJF5YKID04oOopi0fHainRuGG3Pz_jKSrMujPsPk/edit) are available. The user guide is particularly useful for the detailed descriptions of the `TYPECATEGORY` variable not directly available on the data dictionary.


## Missing Data

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}
map(df_syr, ~sum(is.na(.))) %>% head(15) %>% t() %>%
  kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")

map(df_syr, ~sum(is.na(.))) %>% tail(15) %>%t() %>%
  kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
```

Looking at the below it's noted that `kiosk_syringes` (20,730 NAs) has a large amount of missing data, however `ground_syringes` (6275 NAs) has data for almost each entry where `kiosk_syringes` is NA.  

After reviewing the [notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSUqd1peSc-4D2XnBZNiLdxa0Jg4z62D/edit#gid=1183788427) for `kiosk_syringes` and `ground_syringes`:

`ground_syringes`: NULL indicates that the group collecting syringes did not report a quantity of ground syringes collected for that visit, or did not collect syringes from the ground during that visit.  

`kiosk_syringes`: NULL indicates that the group collecting syringes did not report a quantity of syringes removed from a kiosk for that visit (including zero), or did not empty kiosks during that visit.  

Furthermore, after looking more into the data `kiosk_number` also has a large number of NAs, with 18,026 missing values. The notes for the variable are as follows:  

`kiosk_number`: NULL indicates that a kiosk was not present at that location at that time, or the group collecting syringes did not service a kiosk during that visit. 

With this information, some of the NAs in `kiosk_syringe` can have NAs replaced with 0s where a `kiosk_number` is present meaning a kiosk exists, however no syringes were collected that visit. 



```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=8, fig.width=15}
missmap(df, main = "Missing vs Observed Values")
```

## Distributions

### Numeric Variables

From the describe() output for the merged dataset, it is noted that the numeric variables have wide ranges. This will be taken care of through normalization to scale the variables in the preprocessing stage prior to running models. The four numeric variables the dataset are all right skewed.

```{r}
df_n<- df %>% 
  select(c("ground_syringes", "kiosk_syringes", "total_syringes","acres"))

#stats
describe(df_n) %>% 
  select(c(-vars,-trimmed,-mad,-kurtosis))%>%
  kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
```

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#distributions
df_n %>% 
  gather(variable, value, 1:4) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free") +
    geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha=0.9, color="steelblue") +
    geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), alpha=0.2, fill = "lightblue", 
                   color="lightblue", position="identity",bins = 40) +
    theme_light()
```

### Categorical and Date-Time Variables

While this project focuses on the syringes collected in the Bronx, the dataset contains values for other NYC boroughs. Of the 24,654 total syringe collections, 16,325 belong to the Bronx, 8,254 belong to Manhattan, and the renaming observations to Queens, Staten Island, and an unspecified (NA) borough. Some observations don't have a borough associated to the collection record, which could possibly belong to either Brooklyn or any of the other 4 boroughs.  
  
```{r}
df%>%
  select(borough) %>% 
  rename(Borough=borough) %>% 
  count(Borough, name="Total Collections") %>% 
  arrange(-pick(starts_with("Total")))%>% 
  kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
```

As expected, the Bronx has the highest amount of total syringes collected from both grounds and kiosks for the 7 reporting years (2017-2023) with 425,089 syringes collected. Manhattan follows the Bronx with 277,180 syringes collected for the reporting time frame. The other boroughs have minuscule counts in comparison which doesn't necessarily mean that there is less drug usage or less syringes strewn about parks and other properties, but rather that collection efforts aren't as strong in those boroughs as in the Bronx and Manhattan.  

```{r}
df%>% 
  select(c(borough,total_syringes)) %>% 
  group_by(borough) %>% 
  summarise(total=sum(total_syringes, na.rm = T))%>%
  arrange(-total) %>% 
  kable(booktabs=TRUE, col.names = c("Borough", "Total Syringes"))  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
```

Now focusing on the data for the Bronx by year, it is shown that the year with highest syringes collected is 2022. For the years spanning the pandemic, there is a increase of 15,156 syringes collected from 2020 to 2021. The increase in syringes collected also reflects the significant increase in overdoses and deaths attributed to overdoses in 2021. There were 2,668 fatal overdoses in New York City in 2021 which was an increase of more than 500 over the 2020 figure, which itself was 600 deaths above the total in 2019 according to *The New York Times* article, [Fentanyl Helps Push Overdose Deaths to Record Level in New York City](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/nyregion/new-york-overdose-record.html). 

The calculations for year-over-year values and year-over-year rates are as follows:

$YoY= \frac{total - lag(total)}{lag(total)}$ 
$YoY\_Rate =YoY\times100 :rounded\ to\ the\ hundreth$ 

where [`lag()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lag) is a time series shift from the `stats` package.

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(borough=="Bronx") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(total_syringes, na.rm = T))%>%
  mutate(Change = ifelse(year %in% c(2017,2023), "-",total - lag(total)),
         YoY = ifelse(year %in% c(2017,2023), "-", 
                      as.character(round((total - lag(total))/lag(total), 2))),
         YoY_Rate =  ifelse(year %in% c(2017,2023), "-",
                      as.character(round((total-lag(total))/lag(total)*100,2)))) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  kable(booktabs=TRUE, col.names = c("Year", "Total Syringes","Change",
                                     "Year over Year", "Year over Year Rate")) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")

```

Of the 11 Jurisdictions responsible for collections, below are the top 5 for the Bronx.
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(borough=="Bronx") %>% 
  rename(Jurisdiction=jurisdiction) %>% 
  count(Jurisdiction, name="Total Collections") %>% 
  head(5)%>% 
  arrange(-pick(starts_with("Total")))%>% 
  kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
```

Of the 14 different `type_category` levels below are the top 5 with the highest amount of total syringes collected in the Bronx:
```{r}
# df %>% 
#   filter(borough=="Bronx") %>% 
#   rename(Typecategory=typecategory) %>% 
#   count(Typecategory, name="Total Collections") %>% 
#   head(5)%>% 
#   arrange(-pick(starts_with("Total")))%>% 
#   kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
#   kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")

df %>% 
  filter(borough=="Bronx") %>% 
  group_by(typecategory) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(total_syringes, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-total) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  kable(booktabs=TRUE, col.names = c("Type Category", "Total Syringes"))  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
```

Of the 13 different `type_category` levels below are the top 5 with the highest amount of total syringes collected in the Bronx:
```{r}
# df %>% 
#   filter(borough=="Bronx") %>% 
#   rename(Subcategory=subcategory) %>% 
#   count(Subcategory, name="Total Collections") %>% 
#   head(5)%>% 
#   arrange(-pick(starts_with("Total"))) %>% 
#   kable(booktabs=TRUE)  %>%
#   kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")

df %>% 
  filter(borough=="Bronx") %>% 
  group_by(subcategory) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(total_syringes, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-total) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  kable(booktabs=TRUE, col.names = c("Sub Category", "Total Syringes"))  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = "scale_down")
