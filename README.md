# DATA622
**Machine Learning and Big Data**  
**DATA622: Machine Learning and Big Data**  
**Course Description and Learning Outcomes**  

This course aims to develop basic understanding of foundational machine learning techniques. This course will aim to have a smooth transition from statistical modeling methods to machine learning methods. In this course, we emphasize computational techniques. We will primarily use R as our programming environment. All assignments are expected to be submitted as R-Markdown documents.  However, if you are more comfortable using Python, please let me know and we can make some adjustments. 

**Learning Outcomes:**  
Develop deep understanding of introductory machine learning algorithms
Prepare datasets for machine learning algorithms and conduct modeling exercises on given datasets.
Develop understanding to be able to identify problems that require supervised or unsupervised methods.
Develop proficiency of technical terminology expected of a Data Science practitioner.

**Required Textbooks:**  
This course supports both R and Python languages for machine learning. Practical Machine Learning in R (Nwanganga & Chapple) can be purchased, while the Python book is free (as are the optional books).
R is more popular with statisticians (and what we focus on in our courses), while Python is more popular amongst data scientists generally. Choose either Python or R, as both essentially serve the same purpose. 

**Required:**

Python:	While this course is focused on R for a lot of great reasons (it's easier to learn, you should have familiarity from previous courses, etc) I will accommodate those that prefer Python by accepting assignments/homework in Python. However, please buy the "Practical Machine Learning in R" as it covers critical concepts, even if you prefer Python.
